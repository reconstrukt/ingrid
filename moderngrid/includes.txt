Modern Grid Includes:

I've included all required and extra plugins used in the examples in order to be complete.  For most examples, you will need PHP/MySQL (see ajaxExamples for sample PHP files).

Included files:

jQuery-3.0.0.js
jQuery-3.0.0.min.js
bootstrap.css
bootstrap.js
bootbox.js
jquery.jeditable

Note: currently, jeditable is required only if you wish to use edit in place functionality

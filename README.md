 Welcome to Modern Grid! Modern Grid is a jQuery data grid plugin, used to turn static tables into fully interactive tools. Modern Grid is a fork of ingrid (ingrid), re-written to provide more functionality. Some of the key differences:

    Full JSON data support
    Advanced interaction
    Custom right click menu

Modern Grid has been used in high volume production sites for over seven years - it is continually tweaked to ensure compatability with the lastest version of jQuery, and the latest frameworks.
